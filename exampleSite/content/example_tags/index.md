## Tags

Here are examples of how tags work:

 - In the case you have only tags:
    {{ <figure src="./resources/images/only_tags.png"> }}
 - In the case you have tags and a score:
    {{ <figure src="./resources/images/tags_n_score.png"> }}
 - In the case you have a score but no tags:
    {{ <figure src="./resources/images/Notags_n_score.png"> }}
 - In the case you have a score but no tags and the site is deployed:
    {{ <figure src="./resources/images/Notags_n_score_prod.png"> }}
