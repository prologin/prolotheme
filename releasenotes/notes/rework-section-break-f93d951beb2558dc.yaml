    To make a subject with multiple sections, the option `layout: multiple_sections`
    must be added to the front matter of `index.md`.

    The different sections must be named `section-<number>.md` and
    placed in the same directory as `index.md`.

    In each section file, the following front matter must be added
    ```
    ---
    show_toc: true/false
    ---
    ```

    If the value `show_toc` is set to `true`, the section will be displayed with a
    table of content.

    When each sections have a relatively small table of contents, it is possible
    to show only *one* table for the full subject.

    This can be enabled by adding `toc: general` to the front matter of `index.md`.
    In general mode, the table of content will always be shown, therefore, the `show_toc`
    option in each section's front matter will be ignored.

    Table of Content is now visible when using multiple sections.
    Sections of a subject can be separated in multiple files.
deprecations:
  - |
    Tag `[SECTION-BREAK]` no longer usable
