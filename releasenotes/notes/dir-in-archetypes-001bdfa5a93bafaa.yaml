    Add directories in the 'subject' archetype. 
    When you create a subject with the hugo command, it now also creates the
    right subdirectories in addition to the `index.md` and `README.md` files. 

    Usage
    ```
    hugo new -k subject [subject_type]/[subject_name]
    ```

    For example
    ```
    hugo new -k subject micropython/flappy_bird
    ```
