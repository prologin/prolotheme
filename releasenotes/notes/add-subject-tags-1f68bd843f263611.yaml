    Subjects can now be tagged with common tags using the front matter named 
    `tags`, like this:#
    ```
    tags:
      - First
      - Second
      - Third
    ```

    Tags are displayed on the list page and can be clicked to redirect to the 
    list of all subjects that also have this tag. 

    Tags color can be defined in the configuration file like this (example for
    toml config file):#
    ```
    [Params.Tags]
      first = "green"
      second = "#FFFFFF"
      third = "red"
    ```
