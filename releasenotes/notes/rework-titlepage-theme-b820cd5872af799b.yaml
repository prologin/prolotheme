    New style for title page.
    You can use the variable `colorTheme` to set the colors used in the menu.
    They will be used randomly to color the buttons. You can also use 
    `menuOffset` to define the max horizontal offset of the buttons.
    Like the color, the offset will be choosed randomly.
